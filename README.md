I went through a lot of different ideas for plots to create for this dashboard because of how broad the guidelines for the assignment was. I didn't narrow down a topic for the dashboard until later into the project, when I decided it would be interesting to only look at earthquakes since the year 2000. This gave me a more manageable dataset to work with in order to make meaningful plots and in turn a meaningful dashboard. 

### Plot 1
The first plot I knew I wanted was a map that would allow me to visualize where the earthquakes were occuring as well as how powerful they were. My original plot included every earthquake in the dataset, which created an unreadable plot that did nothing to enhance understanding of the topic. I then decided to filter down to only earthquakes since 2000, which ended up being what I created the dashboard around in the end. Still, the map was too cluttered and did little for readers, so I narrowed it down to only "Major Earthquakes", which are defined as any earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher. Throughtout these iterations of the map, I realized that the earthquakes were almost exclusively in lines that formed shapes across the globe, which I attributed to the tectonic plates. I decided to add the plates to the map to show readers why the earthquakes are happening in these particular patterns.

### Plot 2
The second plot I was originally planning on creating was a scatterplot graphing Magnitude against Depth of each earthquake, and then I would add a correlation line if they were somewhat strongly correlated. When I plotted the scatterplot, I realized that the two are not strongly correlated at all, and the plot didn't do anything meaningful. That's when I decided to look at the average depth of an earthquake within each month to see if there was some correlation between time of year and depth. The easiest way to plot this was to make a bar plot showing the average depth in each month since 2000. The plot appears to show that the summer months on average produce some of the deepest earthquakes, while the spring months on average produce some of the shallowest earthquakes.

### Plot 3
The third plot was planned to look at how many earthquakes occured during each month during the year. I originally planned on looking at just one year or taking averages, but I thought it would be
